- Non-linear data structures, allow traversal in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.
- A Graph G = (V, E)
    V: Vertices
    E: Edges
- Has n nodes and n-1 edges.

Types of Graph
--------------
- Directed: Edges have a direction (from one vertex to another).
- Undirected: Edges do not have direction.
- Sparse:	Few edges compared to the number of vertices.
- Dense:	Many edges; number of edges close to maximum possible.
- Complete:	All vertices are connected.
- Cyclic:	Contains at least one cycle.
- Acyclic:	Contains no cycles.

Traversal Algorithms
--------------------
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)	
    Explores neighbors level-by-level using a queue
- DFS (Depth-First Search)	
    Explores as far as possible along each branch using a stack/recursion
