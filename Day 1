JAVA
----
- General purpose, High-level, Object oriented programming language
- Follows WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) principle -> meaning Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- can be used to develop various types of applications
- Platform independent, portable, secure, robust, and supports multithreaded programming

JVM - Java Virtual Machine (How it works)
-----------------------------------------
The JVM executes Java bytecode. It consists of:
  - Class Loader: Loads .class files.
  - Bytecode Verifier: Ensures code security.
  - Execution Engine: Converts bytecode into machine code.

JVM, JDK, JRE
-------------
- JDK: Includes development tools and the JRE.
- JRE: Provides the libraries and JVM needed to run Java applications.
- JVM: Executes Java bytecode.

Compiler vs Interpreter
-----------------------
Compiler: Converts the entire source code into machine code at once. Creates an executable file.
Interpreter: Translates and executes code line by line. Does not create a separate executable file.

Basic strcture of Java
----------------------
- Package declaration
- Import necessary libraries
- Create class & code
